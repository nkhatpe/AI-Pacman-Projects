# AI Pacman Projects

Implementation of AI concepts using Berkeley's Pacman Projects. This series of projects implements various artificial intelligence techniques to help Pacman navigate mazes, collect food, and avoid ghosts.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Search 
- Implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms
- Various heuristic functions for A* search
- Applied to path-finding problems in Pacman maze world

### 2. Multi-Agent Search
- Implementation of minimax and expectimax algorithms
- Alpha-beta pruning optimization
- Evaluation function design for Pacman game states

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Implementation of value iteration and Q-learning
- Approximate Q-learning and state abstraction
- Applied to Pacman for learning optimal behavior

### 4. Probabilistic Tracking
- Implementation of exact and approximate inference
- Particle filtering
- Applied to ghost hunting in partially observable environments

## Technologies
- Python
- AI Algorithms Implementation
- Probabilistic Reasoning
- State Space Search
